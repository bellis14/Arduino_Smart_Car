# Smart Car

## Brief Overview
The smart car application implements line tracking, obstacle avoidance, and manual drive control functionalities using infrared and ultrasonic sensors to drive to cars motors. The hardware used in this project comes from the Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit 3.0 Plus and was purchased from them. The software written on the arduino to control the components and it's peripherals is custom and written by me.
